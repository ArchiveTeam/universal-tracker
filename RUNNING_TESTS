Running the integration tests
=============================

The integration tests assume a Redis server listening on localhost, port
6379.  To change this, make a file in features/support named
redis_conf.rb.  The contents of this file should be a configuration hash
suitable for Redis.new.

For example, to connect to a Redis instance listening on the UNIX socket
/tmp/redis.sock, put the following in features/support/redis_conf.rb:

	{ :path => "/tmp/redis.sock" }

By default, the integration tests run using database 1.  This can be
specified via the db option in redis_conf.rb:

	{ :path => "/tmp/redis.sock", :db => 10 }
